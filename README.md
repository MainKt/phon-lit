# PhonLit

PhonLit is a SvelteKit + PicoCSS project that can transliterate from one Indian language to another. It was built as part of the hackathon organized by Sceptix Club and T&P cell of SJEC.

# Known Bugs

The Generic Script doesn't work yet

# Caveats

Please note that there is a lot of unmaintainable spaghetti code that I wish to fix in future.

# Contributing

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Sceptix Club and T&P cell of SJEC for organizing the hackathon and giving me the opportunity to build this project.
